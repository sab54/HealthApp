 * apiPaths.js
 *
 * This file defines the API endpoint paths used throughout the application. These paths are constants that
 * are used to construct URLs for making HTTP requests to the backend API. They provide a centralized place
 * for managing the paths to various resources like chat, users, health logs, appointments, and steps.
 *
 * Features:
 * - `API_URL_CHAT`: The endpoint for chat-related operations.
 * - `API_URL_USERS`: The endpoint for user-related operations.
 * - `API_URL_HEALTHLOG`: The endpoint for health log-related operations.
 * - `API_URL_APPOINTMENT`: The endpoint for appointment-related operations.
 * - `API_URL_STEPS`: The endpoint for step tracking operations.
 *
 * This file uses the following libraries:
 * - None, this is purely for defining API paths.
